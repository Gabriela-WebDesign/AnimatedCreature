        <h1> Szymon and His Double Trouble Gang</h1>
        <p>Szymon lives in Moddy City and whenever the night falls he flies around the city with his sidekicks, assuring that everything in the Moddy City is in place and all it's citizens are safe. Szymon is half a robot and half an angel and considered to be a royal, due to his blue eyes. His big wings allow him to zoom through the city's skies. However, he owes his superpowers to the magic flower that changes colors and helps him detect any "MODDY" crime. Now to his friends and sidekicks. One of them is called <i>Phunny the Phantom</i>. He flies in the air and has the magic ability to disappear and teleport to a new place where he reappears. Thanks to his quick teleportation skills, he is very helpful to Szymon, since he can cover a huge area of the city in just seconds. The other sidekick is a pig called <b>Poggy</b>. Poggy stays on ground and even though she doesn't look like she can run, on the ground she's the speediest of them all. Poggy's main task is to distract people from the other two fighting the crime and make the criminals confused with why the pig is in the middle of Moddy City. Poggy is not only fast, she's also really strong. After the criminals get captured, she stays with them till the police come. </p>
